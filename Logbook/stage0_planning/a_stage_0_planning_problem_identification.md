# A. Stage 0 - Planning and Problem Identification

# Context
When studing something, consistency is very important so its important for students to mantain healthy and efficient study methods. Given the current state of tecnology, most people have their study materials on digital form, so we decided to create an online platform where students can mannage all their studies on the same place.

# Challenges
Students usually have a hard time mannaging their work. A lot of them don't bother organising their studies because they feel like is a waste of time, so we think they would really bennefit if there was a way to organise studies in a very fast and intuitive way. Also, because the internet is so vast, it would be really benneficial if the your study place would be entirelly customised for you, so you could learn exactly what you need.

# The goal
We evision the creation of a platform where students can have all their study materials, have ways to learn more efficiently and manage study sessions all on the same place.
