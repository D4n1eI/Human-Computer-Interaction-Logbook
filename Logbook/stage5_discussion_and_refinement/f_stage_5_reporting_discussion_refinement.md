# F. Discussion of Evaluation Results

        After scrapping the necessary parts of the low fidelity prototype, the feedback revolved more around some specific icons and how the users sometimes found the ways to get to some pages of the app confusing. The changes made are listed in the next topic.
        When taking these into account we made sure to take a more general approach to how we tackled those problems like using universaly known icons or chaning the UI in a way that would make it easier to understand.
        Some users also gve feedback about the "STUDY" button and how it was difficult for them at first to understand it was connected to the AI. We feel like this issue is not important due to the fact that users always got to the place they needed to go in the end and that the issue is more of around the fact that the AI mascot "Pixel" is supposed to show up the first time the user would log in and explain the basics while introducing himself as the user's AI assistant and how the AI systems work. Since this is not a situation that is present in the prototype, we talked with the users that manifested this difficulty around the "STUDY" button and they all agreed that it would indeed help them and that the UI around that button would be good as it was then.
