# E. Functional Prototype and Evaluation

# Prototype
## Introduction
    We decided to create an app using Electron, with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, because the Electron environment provides us with access to many Node.js modules that help us recreate the same workspace we had in our low-fidelity prototype.
    We also built a working installer for multiple operating systems by leveraging some of Electron’s additional features. This made development easier, especially since some team members use Windows while others use Linux.
## Tasks
    We implemented the same tasks from the low-fidelity prototype, with a few differences. We removed the calendar task view and added a new subtask that allows users to upload a file, rather than just displaying it.
## Notes
    Given our workload and limited time for this project, and even though our app is designed to be “all-in-one”, we chose not to implement some features in this first iteration. These features are marked with a “Not implemented yet” modal, such as the calendar view, editing subjects, and user profiles.
    For simplicity, all pages are hardcoded. Because of this, any user input tasks, such as entering text or selecting a color, must follow specific values. We created a prompts.md file to guide testers on exactly what to type.
