# Self-Evaluation and Workload

Over the course of this project, we learned a great deal about user-centered software development, as well as new development techniques and frameworks.

While the final prototype does not fully solve the initial problem, since the app currently only includes a working frontend with hardcoded pages, it provides a solid foundation for understanding the intended human-computer interaction.

We believe our idea was very promising and well-researched. However, we were unable to implement all desired features due to time constraints and the workload from other subjects.

Nevertheless, we are proud of what we accomplished with this initial prototype and believe there is strong potential for future improvement.

## Highlights

- **Strongest Stage**: Our strongest stage was **Stage 3**, the Low-Fidelity Prototype. It was particularly detailed and comprehensive, laying the groundwork for the digital version of the app. This made the transition to the digital prototype much smoother and provided valuable insights through our usability testing, helping us identify key areas for improvement.
- **Creative Approach**: We took a creative approach, drawing inspiration from similar apps while incorporating original assets. *Studify’s* unique "personality" and user-friendly interface have the potential to stand out from its competitors and become highly relevant in the market.

## Final Evaluation

We rate our overall work as **19 out of 20**. The final product largely met our expectations (excluding the unimplemented features due to time limitations and our current knowledge in areas like artificial intelligence). Additionally, we successfully implemented some extra features we learned along the way.


## Rate Effort
