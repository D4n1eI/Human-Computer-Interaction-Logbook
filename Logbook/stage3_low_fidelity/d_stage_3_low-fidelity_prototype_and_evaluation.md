# Low Fidelity Prototype and Evaluation

## D.1. Low Fidelity Prototype

### Introduction

We decided to create the LFP on paper, so it would be easier to change features and add buttons that do exactly what we want in this initial phase.  
We chose to appeal mostly to users like **"Luis"**, focusing more on **efficiency and responsiveness** rather than customization at this stage.  

We opted for a **sidebar** that's always visible, allowing the user to access their **calendar** and **chat with a general AI model**, while the main content remains centered on the page with **tabs for each subject**.  

In both this prototype and the future high-fidelity one, the user will already be **logged in** and have a subject (**Calculus III**) with a **deadline** created. This is to help testers quickly understand how the app works.  
Although this doesn't consider the initial confusion when a new user creates an account with no subjects, we're choosing not to focus on that for now so that the tests don't become too time-consuming, as there are multiple tasks to complete.  

We also decided to introduce a mascot called **"Pixel"** to increase **user attachment**, a strategy commonly used in similar learning apps like *Duolingo*.

### Tasks

We designed **3 independent tasks**, each pushing different use cases for *Studify*.  
Some tasks are divided into smaller **subtasks** to avoid overwhelming participants:

---

#### **Task 1: Study with AI**

1. In **Calculus III**, make the file `test1.txt` visible to the AI.  
2. Ask a question about that subject.  

> *This tests the user's workflow when studying with AI assistance.*

---

#### **Task 2: Add Subject and Deadline**

1. Create the subject **"Human Computer Interaction"**.  
2. Add a **deadline** to that subject.  
3. View the newly added deadline on your **calendar**.  

> *This task tests both the subject creation and calendar/event management features.*  
> *Note: These subtasks are grouped together since the deadline feature requires an existing subject.*

---

#### **Task 3: Take a Quiz**

1. Complete **"Quiz 1"** for **Calculus III**.  

> *This tests how the user interacts with the quiz functionality in the app.*
