**Name:** Luís Manuel da Silva Leiteiro
**Age:** 18
**Occupation:** University Student
**Location:** Évora, Portugal

## Background
Luís Manuel da Silva Leiteiro is a 18 year old young male adult. He is a student from Portugal in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Aveiro who grew up in Évora. His mother is a lawyer and his father is a movie director. His parents were pretty busy during his childhood and ended up being a bit absent, leaving young Luís do organize his own life, leading to bad habits in his lifestyle. He left home to live alone in Aveiro soon after he turned 18.

## Daily Life
During class, he often zones out but always keeps in mind everything that he can retain when it comes to due dates and exams, which often causes him to forget some of them until one or two days before. He usually gets up late and arrives in classes a bit before the 15 minute rule takes effect, often missing some important info or not being focused enough to retain it. When he gets home, he usually studies for an hour or two and then takes the rest of the day off. When that time is not enough, he ends up overworking himself a couple days before exams and project due dates. He spends a lot of the time he is eating or cleaning his apartment stressing about things he feels like he could be forgetting, sometimes having to call friends just to make sure he really knows what exams to study and projects to do.

## Goals & Needs
Luís always wanted to be a sucessfull Mathematician and help others with their problems, but he always feels like it's hard to do so while being so disorganized. He works and studies regularly but is always haunted by the feeling of not doing enough and that he should organize what he is going to do so he does not waste his time and can take better breaks. He feels like he should be able to help others, but can't help himself.

## Pain Points & Challenges
Everytime Luís tries out an app to organize his work and have everyting in the same spot he is always met with some really weird interfaces and often gets lost within all the options and functionalities, taking him too long to even understand what button does each funtion, which causes him to give up on that app and just continue working like before. He usually does not organize his work at all, but he sometimes hears about these types apps from his friends and decides to give them a shot, even though he is not that much of a tech savvy guy, so the interface being easy to understand is very important to him.

## Motivation
He mostly wants a simple interface to interact with and do his thing, whether that be adding stuff to study with later or using that material, he wants to be able to add and use it fast and effectively so he doesn’t feel like his time is being wasted, since he can get distracted very easily.
