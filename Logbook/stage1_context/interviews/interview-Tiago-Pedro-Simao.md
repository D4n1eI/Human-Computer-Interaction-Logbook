## Task Overview 

 **What task is the user trying to accomplish?** 
  Have a more efficient and organized way to study with everything they get from their professors and their own notes in a single place. 

**What are the main pain points or difficulties they experience?** 
- It takes too long to set up most apps
- Out of their way or inconvinient to use
- Hard to trust material they find online

**Are there any workarounds or strategies they currently use?** 
- They currently mostly use the university's platforms and sometimes make a new pdf file where they put every presentation slide to use later
- They also sometimes use AI platforms to get exercises and sometimes explanations for theorical concepts similar but not exactly the same as the ones their professors give them.

---- 
## Tools & Environment 
**What tools or methods does the user currently rely on?** 
- Sometimes use AI platforms
- Elearning and powerpoint files
- The exercises their professor gives them

**Are there any frustrations or limitations with these tools?** 
- Low adaptability and limited pool of material
- They often feel like they can't trust the material they find online since it could be tailored to a different subject or course

**What features do they wish these tools had?** 
- An easy to use interface so they can quickly get the hang of the app
- Everything in a single place so they can track their work and deadlines much easier while not feeling like they need to go to the internet, instead using the AI feature inside the app containing and using the material of their professors

## Expectations for a Novel Approach 

**What would an ideal solution look like for them?** 
- An easy to use app where they can dump all the files they need and use to get study related help tailored for them and is easy to set up so they dont feel like they are wasting time organizing their study

**What concerns or hesitations do they have about new approaches?** 
- The time it would take to learn to properly use an app like this
- The use of an app like this being something they have to go for specifically and can't just access quickly while studying
- The AI agent helping them study not being accurate enough or not taking enough into account from the files they want and instead getting info from elsewhere

**How do they measure success for completing the task efficiently?** 
- Being able to do what they want with the app fast while not losing anything when it comes to work and study efficiency
- Having proper responses from the AI agent

## Additional Observations 
The main topic of their reasoning is the time for setup and general use. They proritize efficiency of use over evertthing. They also mentioned that having colour coded costumization would help a lot when interacting with calendars and similar things in the interfaces of the app. They also feel like they can't trust much of the stuff they find online and prefer to get material form AI based on what they have already.
