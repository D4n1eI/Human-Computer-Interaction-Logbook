## B.1b. Detailed Competitor Analysis

Competitor chosen  as the main competitor: Notion

### - Heuristic Evaluation

#### Method
The heuristic avaliation process was made by three experts (Daniel, Eduardo and Tiago), following a procedure based on tring the tools for ourselves and taking notes on issues we found while using them. The heuristics follow the ones proposed by the Nielsen Norman Group and the severity scale considered is the one [present on this file](heuristic_evaluations/severity_scale_heuristic_evaluation.md). The consensus were done through individual analysis of each issue we found and then talking about a recommendation we all agree on.

# B.2. Users

## B.2a. Method

Interviews were made to five different university students within the target audience that Project Study will take into account, with some of them being more or less organized than others, but overall around the type of people this tool would be made for. Interviews were done in groups, with the first one being done to a group of 2 and the second to a group of 3, so we could also take into account and ask ideas about group project implementation, which turned out to not be that appealing of an idea to the target audience. The questions asked were all around the types of ways they study, if they have ever tried something similar to this (and if so, ask about their experience with it), how they would like a tool like this to behave or interact with their needs and how would they like to manage it, also making a couple questions around the topic of throwing out ideas just to see if they would be interested in something else or more features being implemented, with the main answers being about how the current setting is more fitting to their needs.
